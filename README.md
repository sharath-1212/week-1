The primary objective of this project is to develop a highly accurate and dependable  E-Waste Image Classification model for categorizing electronic waste based on visual  data. This advanced model will leverage transfer learning with the EfficientNetV2B0  algorithm, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network.
